                    <h2 id="terms">Terms and Conditions</h2>
                    <p>Please read the following carefully. Your use of the Verso site and purchase of the products (or services) ("Products") on it means that you agree to these terms and conditions ("Terms").</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>
                    <p>When you place an Order for a Product ("Order") you are offering to buy it for the price stated, subject to these Terms.</p>
                    <p>When you place your Order online we will send you an email to confirm that we have received it. This email confirmation will be produced automatically so that you have confirmation of your Order details. The fact that you receive an automatic confirmation does not necessarily mean that we will be able to meet your Order. Once we have sent the confirmation email we will then check availability and contact you with a further email. If the Product is available and the details of the Order are correct, this email will be deemed an acceptance and will specify delivery details and confirm the price of the Products purchased. If the Product is not available we will also let you know by email.</p>
                    <p>The Verso Shop may cancel any sale and not supply Products if it is reasonable to do so and may change or discontinue the availability of Products at any time at its sole discretion. If an Order is cancelled, any payment made for the Products will be refunded in full. This does not affect your Statutory Rights.</p>
                    <p>All new Orders are deemed separate and each is treated individually. Products marked "The Verso Shop 1st" are those where The Verso Shop is (or was originally) the first SA-based Internet retailer to supply this product to the SA market.</p>

                    <h2 id="price">Price</h2>
                    <p>The price for each Product is shown on tVerso and includes V.A.T at 20%.</p>
                    <p>We always try to make sure that the prices on verso are accurate but errors may occur. If we discover an error in pricing of the Products in your Order we will inform you as soon as possible using the contact details you supply us with. We will then give you the option of reconfirming your Order at the correct price or cancelling it. (If we are unable to reach you we will treat the Order as cancelled). If an Order is cancelled, any payment made for the Products will be refunded in full.</p>
                    <p>You will be notified of the delivery costs automatically before you submit your credit card details, based on the delivery options you choose. For more information about our delivery charges for despatches to RSA addresses click here.</p>
                    <p>If you order online but pay other than with a credit card, or order in any other way, please contact us for details of the postage cost.</p>
                    <p>Prices are quoted on Verso are in EU - outside the RSA your credit card company should exchange the amount charged to the currency of your country at the current rate. Please note that both charges and refunds are in Eu and The Verso Shop cannot be held responsible for any loss due to exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
                    <p>Non-RSA customers are responsible for Import Duty/Tax in their respective countries. Unfortunately we cannot advise you what these costs will be - please consult your local customs office for more information.</p>
